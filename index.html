        Hello! My name is Bilal Ghauri, a software & 3D enthusiast, and this is my website/portfolio containing my ongoing, completed and future personal projects.
        I'm going to first properly introduce myself to you so you get a feel of who i am. Again, my name is Bilal Ghauri and i was born in Pakistan but did most of my growing up in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
        Over there i completed my A-Levels with average grades in all science and I.T subjects. During this time i realized that i'm quite passionate about programming and software development. So right after completing my A-Levels,
        i decided to pursue a Software Engineering degree in Malaysia. During my degree,
         i completed many modules, grasping deep understanding of Software Development Life Cycles, Databases, User Interfaces, Data Handling, Cloud Services, Document Standards and Design Patterns.
         Sometime around the second year of my degree, the first wave of Covid-19 began, which forced me to spend more time locked at home than going to the university.
         Around this time, i started studying and becoming more and more interested in Visual Arts and 3D Development. Fast Forward a few months, i have completed my degree and i am creating this website using JavaScript (Node.Js) and Three.Js library, joining both my passions for Development and 3D, to showcase some projects from my degree years.      </section>
